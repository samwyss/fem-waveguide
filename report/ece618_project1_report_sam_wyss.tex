% I'm mashing some templates together here. If you write an actual IEEE transactions paper in LaTeX start from their template and then modify things like packages and files you want to include from there as opposed to starting from this document provided in this course.

\begin{abstract}
Three Dimensional Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) analysis is applied to X-Band waveguides and cavity resonator systems. To model these systems \textit{in silico}, leap-frogging time update equations are derived from Maxwell's Equations using the staggered Yee grid. The model is validated using the case of an infinitely long waveguide using Mur's Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC). Perfect electrical conductors (PECs) are used to bound the waveguide as to limit the variation of the Quality Factor, Q, to dielectric loss. An assessment of resonator performance is provided for select materials at 10Ghz which is then compared to theoretical resonator performance.
