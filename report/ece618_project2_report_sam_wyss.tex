\title{Finite Element Comparison of Homogenous Ridged and Non-Ridged X-Band Rectangular Waveguide Dispersion Characteristics}

% I'm mashing some templates together here. If you write an actual IEEE transactions paper in LaTeX start from their template and then modify things like packages and files you want to include from there as opposed to starting from this document provided in this course.

\begin{abstract}
Two dimensional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is applied to assess dispersion characteristics of homogenous rectangular, circular and ridged rectangular X-Band waveguides. To model these systems \textit{in silico}, the weak form of the wave equation is derived from Maxwell's Equations for both TE and TM modes. Perfect electrical conductors (PECs) are used as waveguide walls as to neglect the effect of wave leakage into the environment. The model is validated against the analytical dispersion curves for homogenous rectangular waveguides. Dispersion characteristics of circular waveguides are assessed. A comparison of dispersion characteristics for ridged and non-ridged rectangular waveguides is provided which is then used to assess real world applications of ridged waveguides.
