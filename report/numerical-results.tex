\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numres} 
All update equations as defined in Section \ref{subsec:timestepeqs} were implemented in Rust. This language was chosen for its C++ like performance while enforcing compile-time memory safety which makes writing fast and safe CEM codes relatively easy. An overview of this implementation can be found in \ref{subsec:code}.

Sections \ref{subsec:vv} and \ref{subsec:circ_guides} verifies the model against exact dispersion relations for multiple modes in rectangular waveguides and discusses FEM applicability in modeling circular waveguides respectively. Finally, Section \ref{subsec:rid_guides} compares the dispersion characteristics of the rectangular and ridged rectangular waveguides for multiple modes and discusses practical applications of ridged waveguides.
