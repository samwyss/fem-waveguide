\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numres} 
All update equations as defined in Section \ref{subsec:timestepeqs} were implemented in Rust. This language was chosen for its C++ like performance while enforcing compile-time memory safety which makes writing fast and safe CEM codes relatively easy. An overview of this implementation can be found in \ref{subsec:code}.
